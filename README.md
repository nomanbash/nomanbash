- Hi, I'm Noman. I'm currently working on things that run the gamut from ELT to dashboarding and reporting.
- I'm interested primarily in machine learning and reinforecement learning models and using them in various ways for little projects like analyzing how one spends their own time, whether new-manager bounce is a thing in Premier League Football or whether reinforcement learning is the next thing in optimizing Pit-Stop Strategy.
