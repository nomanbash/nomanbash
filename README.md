- Hi, I'm Noman. I'm currently working as a mish-mash of a Data Engineer, Data Scientist and Data Analyst with some minor work in DevOps.
- I'm interested primarily in machine learning and reinforecement learning models and using them in various ways for little projects like analyzing how one spends their own time, whether new-manager bounce is a thing in Premier League Football or whether reinforcement learning is the next thing in optimizing Pit-Stop Strategy.
- I'm currently learning Azure and refining my knowledge on tensorflow in python.
